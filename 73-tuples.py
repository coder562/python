# tuple data structure
# tuple can store any data type
# most important tuples are immutable,once tuple is created you can't update
# data inside tuple

example =('one','two','three')
# no append,no insert,no pop,no remove
#tuples are faster

#methods

# count,index
# len function
# slicing 
print(example[:2])
